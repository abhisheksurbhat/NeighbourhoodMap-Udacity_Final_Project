# Neighbourhood Map - Udacity Final Project

This project is a single page application for the final project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree.

## Description

This site is a list of famous tourist destinations in Bangalore. 10 such places are picked and shown on the Map.
First, all the points are displayed on the Map, and these points can be filtered based on their name. Locations to be
displayed are selected by clicking on them. Once the locations are filtered, they can be clicked on the Map to get a
short description of the location. Alternatively, the user can also click on the list item to get a short description
of the location. Once visited, the marker will be marked as visited notified by a change in colour.
